 * # compose
 *
 * Returns a function that apply the result of each function to the next one in the opposite order they are defined.
 *
 * > Typescript does not infer the type of the function arguments as you would expect.
 * > You have to explicit type all but the first function argument 😰.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * ```ts
 * compose(
 *     value => `${value} is the result` // '5 is the result'
 *     (value: number) => value / 3, // 5
 *     (value: number) => value - 5, // 15
 *     (value: number) => value * 2, // 20
 * )(10) // '5 is the result'
 * ```
